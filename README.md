Dotcraft
========================================

This is my *dotfiles repository*, which includes all my configuration files located in the `config` folder. The repository also contains installation scripts in the `install` folder to help you configure your system, meant for *Ubuntu* (or *Linux Mint*).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that *git* is installed:
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
```

## Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository by running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vgalovic/dotcraft.git ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
```
# Making Scripts Executable

To run the scripts, you‚Äôll first need to make them executable. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
chmod +x install/*.sh
chmod +x install/setup/*.sh
```
## Running the Setup Script

After making the scripts executable, you can run the main setup script with:

```shell
./install/run.sh
```
> üìù **Note:** Running `run.sh` will automatically prompt you to restart your computer. A restart is required to complete the initial setup. Be sure to save any open work before proceeding.

## Post-Setup

After restarting, you may want to run the following commands to complete the setup:

```shell
 bat cache --build
 ./.dotfiles/install/setup/setup_yazi_plugin.sh
```
These commands can't be run from `run.sh` directly.

## Troubleshooting

The scripts will log their output to `script_output.log`. If something goes wrong during the setup process, you can check this log file to see what happened. This applies to both the `run.sh` script and `setup_yazi_plugin.sh`.

```shell
cat ./dotfiles/install/script_output.log
```
